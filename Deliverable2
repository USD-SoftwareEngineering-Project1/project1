##Problem
In 2016, the president of the University of California wrote an article titled “Why Universities Are The New Startup Incubators” in which she claimed, "A fundamental purpose of universities is to create an environment where students are encouraged to pursue and embrace opportunities, explore new ideas, take intellectual risks and begin the process of becoming the researchers and innovators of tomorrow.”  However, according to the Young Entrepreneurs Council, 75% of college students do not feel they have access to entrepreneurship resources.

University students are in a unique position to pursue their own ideas. Compared to working professionals, young students have a higher risk tolerance and have more room to experiment and handle early successes and failures. University students are immersed in a competitive environment and are eager to achieve success. An article published by Wired observed that "Besides attracting high-achieving individuals, universities house students from multidisciplinary backgrounds and provide a means for such individuals to easily interact with each other due to proximity. Successful early stage startups are founded by a well-rounded team of individuals from diverse backgrounds.” Although universities provide the perfect environment to share and develop new ideas, there are not many effective platforms for students to realize their goals. 

Many university students are creative, skilled, and ambitious and have a strong desire to make something of themselves. Whether it be for personal pleasure, to gain experience, or to build up their resume, many students are eager to work on larger projects. Unfortunately, several obstacles stand in their way. For example some students have ideas that are too large or too broadly scoped to handle alone, some lack expertise to describe and scope their ideas appropriately, some lack the skills and resources to implement their ideas fully, and some have a strong desire to create something new, but lack aa community to brainstorm with and bounce ideas off of. Most high-quality ideas require a diverse group of personalities and skillsets to actualize.

It is imperative that university students have an outlet to connect with other students to exchange, develop, and execute their ideas.

##Solution
We propose to develop a software service that allows university students all disciplines to share their ideas, get feedback on their ideas, and communicate with others who may be interested in bringing their ideas to life.

The overarching goal of our service is to promote the exchange, development, and execution of ideas.

Our service will consist of a publicly available “idea feed” where students can browse ideas posted by other students. Ideas posted will be described in terms of: (1) a catchy title and descriptive subtitle (2) a detailed description of the idea, (3) the team roles and individual skills needed to bring the idea to life, and (4) idea owner and contact information. Students will be able to select ideas from the feed and (1) view more details about the idea, (2) post comments on the idea, and (3) express interest in the idea.  Each user will have a profile displaying their basic information, contact information, and ideas that they have contributed to the application.We hope that our service will encourage the inspiration and generation of new ideas in addition to providing an opportunity to implement of proposed ideas.

We would like our service to be available to a wide audience, so we propose to provide an iOS mobile application, an Android mobile application, as well as a website where users can share ideas, contribute to ideas, and express interest in working on the idea.

##Process
The progress of our project will be driven by 
* Scum meetings twice a week
    * In the scrum meetings, we will discuss mini-deadlines, project-level sprint progress, individual-level backlog progress.
* Two-week-long sprints. 
    * We will form user stories per sprint. They should be short, concise and understandable for the user. The stories will have a format of: As a <role>, I want <feature> so that <reason>.
    * Sprint goals will be defined by the Scrum Master on a high level. The team will provide feedback regarding suggestions for features and goals as well as the feasibility of proposed goals 
    * The tasks of sprint will be broken into four categories, according to the MoSCoW method: (1) Must have requirements, (2) Should have if at all possible, (3) Could have but not critical, (4) Wont have this time, but potentially later.
* Product backlog
    * The sprint goals and mini-deadlines will be translated by each team member into a “product backlog” for their own portion of the project
* Mini-deadlines 
    * A rough schedule of mini-deadlines will be posted in a shared google doc to ensure the goals of the 2 week sprints are met. The mini-deadlines are very informal and do not necessarily need to be met, but serve as to provide direction and set a steady pace of project progress. Mini-deadlines are scheduled for the same day as the scrum meetings. During the scrum meetings, we will address the progress of these mini deadlines, and make adjustments if necessary. 
* Communication
    * Issues can be addressed via email, text, shared google docs, or at the Scrum meetings

Our scrum method was designed to address the following issues
* We all have busy schedules and cannot afford to meet every day to discuss the project. It is not even expected that team members work on the project every day. We are understanding and sympathetic to the demands of college lifestyle.
* We are each developing our service on a different platform. Although these platforms are independent of one another on an implementation level, each platform will be accessing the same database and is expected to provide the same experience to the user. It is necessary that we collaborate and agree on high-level UI decisions and establish a cohesive data model, however low-level implementation decisions will be left up to each independent developer. For this reason, goals will be defined on a very high level by the scrum master, and translated by each member into project-level requirements.
* We are classmates and are comfortable with one another on a social level, therefore informal text and email communication is encouraged.
