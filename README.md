Problem Statement: 
People often come up with good ideas, but lack the skills and resources to implement them. Creative, ambitious, and motivated individuals often do not have an outlet for their goals. Our vision is to create a space for students of all disciplines to share their ideas, get feedback on their ideas, and communicate with others who may be interested in bringing their ideas to life.

Design: All team members will contribute to UI design, database organization design, and architectural design. The three facets of our project are distinct and separate and it is therefore crucial that we all agree on a coherent organization and presentation of content.
